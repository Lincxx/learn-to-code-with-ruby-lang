#----------- review of inheritance
## What is inheritance?
# inheritance is a way for a class to obtain all methods from another class
# inheritance avoids duplicate code across multiple classes
# the class inherited from is called the superclass or parent class
# the class that inherits is called the subclass or child class
# Ruby only supports single inheritance. A class can only inherit from one other class
# the sublcass is a type of superclass. this is called an "is-a" relationship
# the relationship does not apply in reverse
# thus, the subclass can be called a subset of the superclass
# a car "is-a" vehicle but a vehicle is not guaranteed to be a car
# subclasses are followed by a < symbol and the name of the superclass

#----------- create subclass
# refer to "subclass.rb"

#----------- check inheritance hierarchy
# refer to "subclass.rb"

#----------- the .is_a? and .instance_of? predicate methods
# refer to "subclass.rb"

#----------- exclusive instance methods in subclasses
# refer to "subclass.rb"
#----------- override methods in a subclass
# refer to "subclass.rb"

#----------- the super keyword I 
# refer to "subclass.rb"

#----------- the super keyowrd II
# super without parentheses
# super with parentheses but no arguments
# super wit parentheses and arguments
# refer to "super_keyword.rb"

#----------- class variables across subclass
#----------- singleton classes and singleton methods
#----------- hash as intiialize argument I
#----------- hash as intiialize argument II
